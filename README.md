This bash script is designed to automate the creation of Virtual Machines (VMs) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). It prompts the user for necessary inputs such as the compartment ID, subnet ID, base image ID, VM shape, and the boot size. It also allows the user to add multiple block devices to the VMs.

chmod +x create-vm.sh

Usage

    Navigate to the directory where the script is located:

./create-vm.sh

    Follow the prompts to enter the required information. The script will prompt you for the following information:

    VM hostname list
    Compartment ID
    Subnet ID
    Base Image ID (not currently working)
    VM shape

    The script will display a list of VMs that will be created based on the entered hostname list. Verify that the list is correct before proceeding.

    Choose the instance shape for the VMs from the list displayed in the prompt.

    Enter the boot size for the VMs.

    If you want to add a block device to the VMs, enter "Yes" when prompted and provide the block name and size.

    If you want to add more block devices, enter "Yes" when prompted and provide the block name and size.
